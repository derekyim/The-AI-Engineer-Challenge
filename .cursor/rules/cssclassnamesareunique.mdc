# Your rule content
when making css classnames they should be unique to the class you are working in.  This is so styles from a certain component do not interfere with another

So for the files
[ChatMessage.tsx](mdc:ui/components/ChatMessage.tsx)
@ui/components/ChatMessage.module.css

The classnames in css for example for a dialog-content class should start with the dash-case-name-of-the-component, then use the actual css name ie dialog-component.
for the ChatMessage component, convert the name to skewer or dash case like: chat-message
you would use the name
chat-message-dialog-content
