 # Use Types for Props

**Glob:** `**/*.tsx`

When defining props for React components, use `type` instead of `interface`. Types are more flexible and better suited for props as they are more easily composed and can represent unions.

## ✅ Correct Usage

```typescript
type MyComponentProps = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};
```

## ❌ Incorrect Usage

```typescript
interface MyComponentProps {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}
```

## Rationale
- Types are more flexible for composition
- Better support for union types
- More consistent with modern TypeScript practices
- Simpler to refactor and maintain
