### Rules for Frontend

- You must pay attention to visual clarity and contrast. Do not place white text on a white background.
- You must ensure the UX is pleasant. Boxes should grow to fit their contents, etc. 
- When asking the user for sensitive information - you must use password style text-entry boxes in the UI.
- You should use Next.js as it works best with Vercel. 
- This frontend will ultimately be deployed on Vercel, but it should be possible to test locally. 
- Always provide users with a way to run the created UI once you have created it.

### Theme & Color Palette

- You must follow the **Official Google Color Palette** for all UI components:
  - **Google Blue**: `#4285F4` - Primary actions, links, and interactive elements
  - **Google Red**: `#EA4335` - Errors, alerts, and destructive actions
  - **Google Yellow**: `#FBBC05` - Warnings and highlights
  - **Google Green**: `#34A853` - Success states and confirmations
- Use these colors consistently across buttons, icons, text accents, and status indicators.
- For neutral colors, use Google's recommended grays:
  - Text primary: `#202124`
  - Text secondary: `#5F6368`
  - Borders/dividers: `#DADCE0`
  - Background: `#FFFFFF` (light) or `#202124` (dark mode)
- Maintain sufficient contrast ratios (WCAG AA minimum) when combining these colors.
- Use Google Blue as the primary brand/accent color throughout the application.
