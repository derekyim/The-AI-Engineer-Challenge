# Your rule content

we have an .eslintrc file in this project
please follow these linter rules for all new code written


Be vigilant about TypeScript errors when writing code. 
TypeScript type safety is important for maintaining code quality and preventing runtime errors.
When writing tests or any TypeScript code, make sure to:
Add explicit type annotations for variables, especially empty arrays and objects where TypeScript can't infer the type
Use proper type assertions when necessary (using as syntax)
Define interfaces or types for complex objects
Check for null/undefined values and handle them appropriately
Pay attention to function parameter and return types

basically
follow all rules in the tsconfig.json 

follow .editorconfig too
